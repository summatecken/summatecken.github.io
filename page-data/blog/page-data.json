I know that when\n        I first learned about CSS I thought it was a very tedious\n        process to write for example ul li a {} to change link\n        elements in a list, and then if I wanted to do a hover effect I'd\n        write ul li a:hover {} which made the style sheet pretty\n        cluttered. But with pre-compiled CSS it is easier to read \n        and understand.</p>\n    <p><b>Which techniques did you use?</b></p>\n    <p>In this project I mostly used just nesting and variables,\n      since I didn't find it too usable to use modules for example\n      as this is a very basic blog site. I did try some other\n      functionality such as @extend and operators and can\n      absolutely see benefit in using these.</p>\n    <p><b>Pros and cons?</b></p>\n    <p>Pros are speed of development, maintenance and reduced clutter.\n    Cons are that you need additional software (which can be installed in for example Node.js) to make use of it, while regular CSS needs no additional setup.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"https://jr223cs.github.io\" data-width=\"480\" data-numposts=\"3\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"postContainer\">\n  <div class=\"postTitle\">\n    <h2>What do you think of static site generators?</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"postContent\">\n    <p><b>What type of projects are they suitable for?</b></p>\n    <p>The way I understand it is that it works good for quick\n    jobs, for example a client who wants a website that displays\n    opening hours and contact information for a restaurant, and\n    then it would be very easy to update the information by editing\n    the markdown files if there are any changes in the schedule. I think that\n    quick setup and flexible dynamic content are key points here.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"https://jr223cs.github.io\" data-width=\"480\" data-numposts=\"3\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"postContainer\">\n  <div class=\"postTitle\">\n    <h2>What is robots.txt and how have you configured it for your site?</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"postContent\">\n    <p>It's a file that tells web crawlers / indexers about\n    what content is allowed to be fetched. From what I understand,\n    having a robots.txt does not work for this assignment since it requires \n    to be placed in the top domain's root, which is not the case in this\n    assignment as we use github pages. Instead I've added meta tags\n    for name=robots, which has the rules \"noindex\" and \"nofollow\".\n    However, having such rules does not apply to all bots, it\n    only applies to those that conforms to those rules.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"https://jr223cs.github.io\" data-width=\"480\" data-numposts=\"3\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"postContainer\">\n  <div class=\"postTitle\">\n    <h2>What is humans.txt and how have you configured it for your site?</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"postContent\">\n    <p>It's a text file that lists all people involved with the\n    website, and optionally software and other information can\n    be added too. It is not required and not all sites use it.\n    I have added a link tag to it, but it is not accessible\n    as with the robots.txt, since it has to be\n    placed in the top domain's root.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"https://jr223cs.github.io\" data-width=\"480\" data-numposts=\"3\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"postContainer\">\n  <div class=\"postTitle\">\n    <h2>How did you implements comments to blog posts?</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"postContent\">\n    <p>I'm using facebook's comments plugin to make it possible to comment with a facebook account.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"https://jr223cs.github.io\" data-width=\"480\" data-numposts=\"3\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"postContainer\">\n  <div class=\"postTitle\">\n    <h2>What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"postContent\">\n    <p>It is is a way of telling how a website's thumbnail should be displayed when shared.
